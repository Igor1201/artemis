## 2.1.0+1

## 2.0.4
- Bump `gql` package

## 2.0.3
- Generate every field of input objects

## 2.0.2
- Support `__schema` key under the data field or on root of `schema.json`.

## 2.0.1
- Loosen up dependencies to make it work again with Flutter `beta` channel

## 2.0.0
- BREAKING: move `GraphQLError` to `package:gql`. If you don't use it, or just
  reference it indirectly, it will not be breaking, but a major will be bumped
  anyway, just for sure.
- Upgrade `package:gql` to version `0.7.4`
- Build GQL AST into generated Dart code instead of the raw string
- Use `Link` from `package:gql/link` as the execution interface of `ArtemisClient`
- Use `package:gql_dedupe_link` and `package:gql_http_link` as the default links

## 1.0.4
- Add a test to guarantee query inputs can be lists

## 1.0.3
- Disable implicit casts
- Avoid double-parsing the source string

## 1.0.2
- Differentiate lists from named types when looping through variables
- Consider nullable operation name when defining query name

## 1.0.1
- Upgrade `gql` to version `0.2.0` to get rid of direct dependency on `source_span`
  and for better parsing errors.
- Filter for `SchemaMap` with `output` when generating code

## 1.0.0
- Breaking: Add required `output` option to `SchemaMap`
- Make Artemis a `$lib$` synthetic generator
- Add `add_query_prefix` option to `SchemaMap`

## 0.7.0
- Make generated classes a mixin of `Equatable`, meaning they can be easily comparable with `==`

## 0.6.1
- Include pubspec.lock files of examples

## 0.6.0
- Replace `graphql_parser` with `gql` package

## 0.5.1
- Add most documentation
- Increase pana grade (health and maintenance)
- Fix some stuff related to importing http on client

## 0.5.0
- Start using `code_builder` to better generate Dart code

## 0.4.0
- Allow scalar mappings to include imports for types

## 0.3.2
- Decode HTTP response as UTF-8 on execute helper.

## 0.3.1
- Export common used files on default package route (`package:artemis/artemis.dart`)
- Use single schemaMap globbing stream to make sure only one schema will be found
- Add missing changelog
- Test new github actions

## 0.3.0 BREAKING
- Add new generators to GraphQLQuery and QueryArguments
- Fix toJson() on JsonSerializable classes (for nested entities)
- [BREAKING] Remove the `execute*` functions generations, to use instead the generic `ArtemisClient` class
that should receive a GraphQLQuery generated subclass.

## 0.2.1
Set HTTP headers only when using default HTTP client.

## 0.2.0 BREAKING
Completely overhaul how this works.

Artemis won't generate a full schema typing anymore. Instead, it will use the schema to generate typings from a specific query or mutation. It will also create helper functions to execute those queries. See [README](./README.md) for more info.

This is totally a breaking change but as this library is still on alpha, I should keep it under 1.0.

## 0.1.3
- Make objects that implement interfaces override resolveType

## 0.1.2
- Improve package score

## 0.1.1
- Enable tests on pipeline

## 0.1.0
- "Fix" json_serializable dependency
- Add tests
- Generate union types as inheritance
- Generate interface types as implementation
- Make generated code choose inheritance

## 0.0.1
- First release
- No tests
- No documentation
- Parse complex GraphQL schemas (incorrectly, now I know)
- Parse all GraphQL types types (union, interface, enum, input object, object, scalar, list, non null)
- Consider custom scalars
- Not even compile from scratch
- Lot of bugs
